      <h1>S-Process Developer</h1>

      <p>
        Lightcone Infrastructure is seeking a full-stack web developer to maintain and improve an existing grant
        evaluation app
        to make it easier for philanthropists to delegate grant-making decisions to trusted advisors. The app is
        currently
        being used by philanthropists Jaan Tallinn and Jed McCaleb, via the Survival and Flourishing Fund, and we
        believe
        it is time to improve it and make it accessible to other philanthropists and cause areas.
      </p>

      <h2>Why this position exists</h2>

      <p>
        Over the past few years, the interest of large philanthropic donors in improving the long term future of
        humanity
        has drastically increased. The central duty of this position would be to develop software and manage a process
        that
        allows those philanthropists to effectively and efficiently distribute their funds.
      </p>

      <h2>Duties of position</h2>

      <p>
        This position would work on app development full-time, reporting to Oliver Habryka at Lightcone Infrastructure,
        and advised by Dr.
        Andrew Critch at the Center for Human-Compatible AI. Activities will include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Implementing and adjusting mathematical formulas for combined decision-making.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prototyping and designing visual user-interfaces for manipulating grant evaluations, utility functions and
          collective decision-making algorithms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Working from the Lightcone Offices 3-5 business days per week, including daily morning standup meetings (20
          mins)
        </li>
        <li>
          Weekly 1-1s with Oliver (1-2 hours) and Friday-afternoon retrospectives and product demonstrations (2 hours).
        </li>
        <li>
          Meeting with Andrew for up to 2 hours every two weeks, with occasional day-long sprints.
        </li>
        <li>
          Performing weekly user-interviews with test-users and present users of the app (2-4 hours/week total).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our organizational culture</h2>

      <p>
        The Lightcone Infrastructure team operates on sprint-based agile principles, with a very strong emphasis on
        user-interviews,
        quickly prototyping ideas, and a heavily collaborative atmosphere. In this role, your focus will be on deeply
        understanding the needs and interests of highly numerate philanthropists who might want to use this application,
        and
        it will be crucial to identify a coherent product-direction, while staying responsive and unopinionated about
        the
        details of how the application is implemented.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Lightcone Infrastructure team fosters the expression of strong disagreements, although this position doesn’t
        particularly
        need
        a person with strong pre-conceptions about how the app should be developed (in fact, they’ll need to be fairly
        different to early users and advisors).
      </p>

      <h2>Qualifications</h2>

      <p>
        Coming into this job, you will need to be able to develop software at the level of a strong graduate from a
        computer
        science university program. In addition, you’ll need to possess (or develop) a broad base of other skills,
        ranging
        from user-centric product development to UI design to mathematical analysis and development of new algorithms
        for
        collective decision-making. It’s okay if you don’t have experience with those additional skills at the start,
        but you’ll need a high aptitude for developing them quickly.
      </p>

      <h2>Salary & Visa Sponsorship</h2>

      <p>
        Salary will be at least $120k plus healthcare, and can be negotiated upward to be competitive with full-stack
        web
        development in the Bay Area. We can also obtain H1B visas for this position if need be (or an equivalent E3 for
        Australian applicants).
      </p>
