      <h2>Campus Team – Generalist</h2>
      <p>Lightcone Infrastructure is looking for exceptional generalists who want to dedicate themselves to ensuring
        that humanity survives this century. Lightcone Infrastructure is a small early-stage organization with five
        team members.</p>
      <h2>About the Team</h2>
      <p>We are building a community dedicated to ensuring that humanity survives this century and successfully
        colonizes the stars. Currently, we build LessWrong.com, the AI Alignment Forum, and the Lightcone Offices as
        well as organize many events and retreats for people working on safeguarding humanity’s future.</p>
      <p>The most serious risk to humanity’s future that we are aware of is the creation of powerful unaligned
        Artificial Intelligence, and reducing that risk is the primary focus in our daily operations.</p>
      <p>It seems to us that successfully avoiding that risk requires substantial conceptual, empirical and
        technological breakthroughs in AI Alignment, as well as substantially improved global institutions for
        handling risks from new technologies. We aim to create a world-class research and entrepreneurial environment
        where the seeds of these breakthroughs can grow, and from which that institutional change can start.</p>
      <p>We currently support thousands of active members on LessWrong and hundreds of professionals working in the
        Bay Area who attend our events and work from the Lightcone Offices. We aim to grow both our online and our
        offline community, and make it one of the worlds best places for making intellectual progress and starting
        ambitious projects.</p>
      <h2>Organizational Culture</h2>
      <p>The Lightcone Infrastructure Team operates on sprint-based agile principles, with a very strong emphasis on
        user-interviews, quickly prototyping ideas, and a heavily collaborative atmosphere.</p>
      <p>The Lightcone Infrastructure Team fosters the expression of strong disagreements. At the same time
        individuals are given responsibility for problems and products with the power to make decisions based on their
        inside views to the contrary of others on the team.</p>
      <p>A core team value is thinking for yourself. Any individual on the team is expected to build their own models
        of how to best approach world-scale problems like AI Alignment, build their own expertise in community and
        institution building and do many independent back of the envelope calculations when facing a new problem
        domain. We take inspiration from the motto of the royal society: <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullius_in_verba"><em>Nullius in verba</em></a><em> (On no one's
          word).</em></p>
      <p>The community and team strongly emphasizes
        written communication. For instance, team members stay up to date with new research on the AI Alignment
        Forum and LessWrong; team members also regularly write many-page memos explaining their plans and ideas to
        other team members.</p>
      <p>We generally think of ourselves as a small
        startup. This means we tend to throw ourselves at problems fully, and we want to maintain the intensity of
        our current operating culture, so you should expect to work occasional weekends and late evenings.
      </p>
      <h2>The Role</h2>
      <p>We are looking for exceptional generalists who have the potential to develop in a variety of directions and
        take on many possible roles in the future. Working in this role will involve solving a wide range of problems,
        ranging from research tasks, to software engineering problems to solving the operational and logistical
        problems inherent in building a community center and office space. Over time, both as our organization and
        projects grow, you should expect to take on major responsibilities, including managing large project teams of
        30+ people and allocating tens of millions of dollars.</p>
      <p>Some example tasks that have come up in the past include figuring out how to publish professional quality
        books, building grantmaking software for allocating millions of dollars, furnishing an office for over 30
        people, and evaluating technical alignment research on LessWrong. Nobody on the team had done any of these
        things before, but everyone was willing to learn and capable of picking up the necessary skills, and request
        help from the team and external advisors when needed.</p>
      <p>The best candidates will have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ability to complete ambitious projects with high autonomy.</li>
        <li>Strong self-direction and self-motivation.</li>
        <li>Directness and openness in giving and receiving feedback.</li>
        <li>A strong ability to communicate through writing.</li>
        <li>Comfort with betting on beliefs and making trades with money and other units.</li>
        <li>Comfort with intense discussion and debate, including challenging one’s manager.</li>
        <li>A drive to question and improve everything about the organization rather than taking it as given.</li>
        <li>Willingness to build robust inside views on how to successfully navigate civilization through this
          century.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Automating yourself away with software is one of the key values of Lightcone Infrastructure, so any member is
        expected to already have, or quickly learn, the skills necessary to automate any simple data-entry task and
        build their own simple applications or spreadsheets to guide commonly recurring tasks.</p>
      <h2>Additional information</h2>
      <p>The team is in Berkeley, California, and team members must be here full-time. Our current salary policy is to
        pay rates competitive with industry salary minus 30%. Given prevailing salary levels in SF for the kind of
        skill level we are looking at, we expect salaries to start at $150k/year plus healthcare (but we would be open
        to paying $315k for someone who would make $450k in industry).</p>
      <p>We can obtain H-1B and E3 visas for those who need them, and are willing to put in a lot of work to solve any
        particular visa issues.</p>
